# README: Rain in Australia Prediction Project
### Project Title
Rain in Australia: Predictive Modeling of Rainfall Patterns

### Description
This project focuses on analyzing historical weather data from Australia to predict rain events using machine learning algorithms and regression models. The dataset is preprocessed, and features are engineered to improve prediction accuracy.

### Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data for modeling.

Regression Models: Built to predict rain events based on variables such as temperature and humidity.

Feature Engineering: Improved model accuracy through the addition of new features.

### Tools & Libraries Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, ggplot2

### Files

RainPrediction.py: Main script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
RainData.csv: Historical weather data from Australia.

### README.md: This documentation.
How to Run

Clone the repository and load the RainData.csv file.

Open and run RainPrediction.py in a Python environment.

The script will output predictions and visualizations based on the model.
