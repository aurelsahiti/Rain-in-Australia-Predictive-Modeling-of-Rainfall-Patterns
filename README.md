# Rain in Australia: Predictive Modeling of Rainfall Patterns  

**Prepared by Aurel Sahiti**  

---

## Executive Summary  
Australia’s rainfall patterns have significant implications for agriculture, water resources, and environmental planning. This project uses predictive modeling on the “Rain in Australia” dataset to forecast whether it will rain tomorrow, enabling better operational decisions for stakeholders in farming, infrastructure, and climate resiliency.

Using Python, this analysis explored historical rainfall, weather, and location data to build classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost) for predicting rainfall occurrence. The findings reveal strong predictors such as humidity, cloud cover and previous rainfall — and show that models can reliably anticipate rain occurrence with accuracy, enabling proactive strategies for irrigation, supply chain, and resource allocation.

Based on the model outcomes, I recommend:  
- Enhancing data collection for key predictors (humidity, pressure change, cloud cover) to improve model performance.  
- Deploying the best-performing model as a real-time alert system for farmers and utility managers.  
- Integrating climate forecasts with rainfall prediction to support longer-term planning.

These recommendations form a framework for turning historical weather data into actionable climate analytics.

## Business Problem  
Water-intensive industries, agriculture, and resource managers need reliable rain-prediction insights to optimize operations, minimize waste, and avoid disruption. Key business questions addressed:  
- Which weather parameters best indicate imminent rainfall?  
- How accurate and timely can predictions be for next-day rain?  
- What actionable steps can organizations take based on rainfall forecasts?

The goal of this project was to build a **predictive modeling workflow** using machine learning to forecast the probability of rain tomorrow — from which businesses can derive meaningful operational strategies.

## Methodology  
The modeling pipeline followed these steps:

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**  
   - Imported the “Rain in Australia” dataset (from Kaggle) into Python.  
   - Cleaned missing values, converted dates, and encoded categorical variables (e.g., location, wind direction). 

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Examined target distribution (RainTomorrow).  
   - Investigated key predictors: humidity, temperature, pressure, cloud cover, rainfall.  
   - Visualized variable relationships and temporal patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created lag features (previous day’s rain, prior rainfall amount).  
   - Generated rolling averages for humidity, cloud cover, and pressure over past 3-5 days.  
   - Encoded categorical wind direction and included seasonal features (month, day).  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Split data into training (80 %) and test (20 %) sets.  
   - Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC and confusion matrix.

5. **Model Interpretation & Recommendations**  
   - Identified top predictors using feature importance scores.  
   - Analyzed misclassification patterns and recommended deployment considerations.
